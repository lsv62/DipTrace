        Recover Board -  recover the latest project version

    Placement
        * Arrange Components - components will be arranged according to 
          the placement settings near the design center

    View
        * Component Markings - set reference designators visibility
        * Units - change the measurement units
        * Precision - configure precision of all the values in the project
        * Origin - see the origin point
        * Mirror - see how the bottom layer actually looks like

    Objects
        * Place Ratline -  create a pad-to-pad connections visually
        * Place Board Outline - place the board outline on the design area
        * Board Points - n Add, Insert and Delete key points
        * Delete Board - delete the outline polygon

    Route
        * Connection Manager - add, delete or rename nets, as well as add or 
          delete pads to/from the nets
        * Lock Net Structure - protect the net structure from accidental change
        * Current Autorouter
            * Shape Router - the best option for complex and simple designs 
            * Grid Router - options for jumper wires
            * Run DRC after autorouting - switch on design rules check
        * Autorouter Setup - set up the autorouter
        * Route Setup - the trace width and clearance between traces
        * Run Autorouter - route the circuit board
        * Layer Setup - add, edit, create or delete a layer
        * Via styles - set via type and size
        * Manual Routing

    Verification
        * Check Design Rules - verifies object sizes, length/phase parameters o
          f highspeed nets, and clearances between different objects
        * Design Rules - change design rules
